<h2>MIXED NOTIONS&mdash;NO. IV. EGYPT.</h2>

<blockquote><p><i>Two</i> Well-Informed Men, <i>an</i> Inquirer, <i>and an</i> Average Man, <i>in
suburban morning train to London</i>.</p></blockquote>

<div class="drama">
<p><i>First Well-Informed Man</i> (<i>reading his paper</i>). Oh, I say, dash it,
this'll never do. Here's this young <span class="sc">Khedive</span> of Egypt kicking up a
shine, and dismissing British Ministers. We can't have that, you know.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What Ministers has he dismissed?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why, British Ministers,&mdash;at least (<i>reading on</i>) I
mean Egyptian Ministers; that's to say, chaps whom we appointed.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Come, come, we couldn't appoint Egyptian
Ministers, could we?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, it comes to exactly the same thing; they're
appointed subject to our proviso (<i>consulting paper</i>), yes, subject to our
veto, and then this little whipper-snapper goes and gives them the
chuck. He'll jolly soon have to climb down off that.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Gently! The young chap's King, after all, isn't he?
I thought Kings might appoint or dismiss Ministers as they liked.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, rot! The <span class="sc">Queen</span> can't appoint her own
Ministers. We all know that. They're appointed by the Prime
Minister. Any fool knows that.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But who appoints the Prime Minister?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> He appoints himself, and tells the <span class="sc">Queen</span> he's
done it. They all go and kiss hands and get their seals, or something
of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course, of course. I forgot that. But how about
these Egyptian beggars?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> The <span class="sc">Khedive's</span> had the cheek to dismiss the
Ministry, and shove another lot in. I see Lord <span class="sc">Cromer</span> has been to
the Palace to protest.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Lord <span class="sc">Cromer</span>! Who's he?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear fellow, fancy not knowing that! Lord
<span class="sc">Cromer's</span> our Ambassador at Cairo.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, nonsense. There are no ambassadors at Cairo.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Aren't there? Oh, indeed. Well, then perhaps
you'll tell me what Lord <span class="sc">Cromer</span> is?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> He's our Minister. That's what they call them.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Was it him the <span class="sc">Khedive</span> dismissed, then?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>laughing heartily</i>). No, no; we haven't got to
that yet. He dismissed his own Johnnies, of course; Egyptians.
Lord <span class="sc">Cromer's</span> the English Minister.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> No, he isn't. He's the English Agent.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, well, it's the same thing.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>taking his revenge</i>). No, it isn't at all the same
thing; it's a very different thing. A Minister's only just short of
an Ambassador, and an Agent (<i>pauses</i>)&mdash;well, he's something quite
different. I don't think he gets as much pay for one thing, and of
course he can't live in the Embassy.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But who does live in the Embassy, then?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's unoccupied, of course.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> No, it isn't. There isn't any Embassy at all. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>returning to the charge</i>). But look here, who <i>is</i> Lord
<span class="sc">Cromer</span>? I never heard of him before. I thought we'd got <span class="sc">Baring</span>
or <span class="sc">Rothschild</span>, or somebody representing us in Egypt.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>with smiling superiority</i>). My dear chap, you're
thinking of Sir <span class="sc">Evelyn Baring</span>. He left Egypt long ago.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Why did he leave?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Old <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> gave him the sack.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, he didn't. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> wasn't in power
when <span class="sc">Baring</span> left Egypt. It was <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> who dismissed him.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I bet you a sov. it was <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> And I bet you a sov. it was <span class="sc">Salisbury</span>.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> You'll both lose. It was neither.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i>, <i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>together</i>). Bosh! That's
impossible.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> It's a fact.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>triumphant</i>). Well, how do you account for his
not being there now?</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> He is there.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> He isn't. Lord <span class="sc">Cromer's</span> there. Here it is. (<i>Producing
Times.</i>) "Lord <span class="sc">Cromer</span> has protested in person." So come!</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> All right. I know all that. Only, unfortunately,
they're one and the same person.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i>, <i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>together</i>). Oh, I daresay; and
you think we're going to swallow that. You tell that to your
Grandmother!     [<i>Both remain absolutely unconvinced.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But what's this about the French? What have they
got to do with it?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, they've got their fingers in every pie;
always making mischief.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Quite true; but they'll find we're going to sit
tight in spite of them, so the sooner they cart themselves and their
blessed old Pyramids out of the country the better.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Why should they take the Pyramids?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, they built 'em, so I suppose they've got a
right to do what they like with them.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course.         [<i>Terminus.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord Strathsporran</i> (<i>to</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Tidmarsh</span>). Afraid I'm most abominably
late&mdash;had some difficulty in getting here&mdash;such
a fog, don't you know! It's really uncommonly
good of you to let me come and see your
antiquities like this. If I am not mistaken, you have
got together a collection of sepulchral objects

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Well, I only thought&mdash;we used to be such friends
once. You seem so changed!</p>

<p><i>Miss Seaton.</i> I am not the only one who is changed, I think. You
seem to have changed everything&mdash;even your name. What ought I
to call you, by the way, I didn't catch it exactly. "Lord <span class="sc">Somebody</span>,"
wasn't it?</p>

<p><i>Lord Strath.</i> Never mind the confounded name, I have heard quite

<p>There is something fascinating
about the title of
Mr. <span class="sc">McCullagh  Torrens</span>'
book, published in
one handsome volume, by
<span class="sc">Bentley</span>. There should
be a good deal in <i>Twenty
Years in Parliament</i>,
more so when the epoch
covers recollections of
<span class="sc">Palmerston</span> in his green
old age, Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
in his prime, <span class="sc">Bright</span> in
his political prize-fighting
trim, <span class="sc">Cobden, Tom Duncan,
Monckton Milnes,
John Stuart Mill, Isaac
Butt</span>, and a host of other
ghosts that have flitted
off the scene. My Baronite
turned to the book
with gusto, read it
through with patience,
and left it with disappointment.
Mr. <span class="sc">Torrens</span>
knew all these men personally; in fact, he was indispensable to
them. One marvels to find, from hints dropped and assertions
boldly made, how much they were severally indebted to him for
counsel and inspiration through the twenty years the narrative
vaguely covers. The figures of the men named loom large in
history; but they were all stuffed. The wires were pulled by plain
unappreciated <span class="sc">McCullagh Torrens</span>. The weight of the responsibility
has had the effect of somewhat muddling the narrative, and,
from time to time, the diligent reader does not know exactly where
he is. He begins with some episode in which <span class="sc">Dizzy</span>, with arm
affectionately linked with that of <span class="sc">McCullagh Torrens</span>, is walking
along Pall Mall, when a passing Bishop obsequiously takes off his
hat and bows. <span class="sc">McCullagh</span> modestly says this obeisance was paid
to <span class="sc">Dizzy</span>, but <i>we</i> know very well it was to <span class="sc">McCullagh</span>. Then,
before we know where we are, we are in the middle of an account of
the Bulgarian atrocities, the Russo-Turkish war, what Count <span class="sc">Beust</span>
said to <span class="sc">McCullagh</span>, and how, in debate on the Vote of Six Millions,
"a Right Hon. friend who sat next to me urged me to add a few
words to what had been better said by others in this sense." Better
said! Oh, <span class="sc">McCullagh</span>! Oh, <span class="sc">Torrens</span>! There is an ancient story
of an old gentleman who had a treasured anecdote connected with
the going off of a gun. When he could not drag it in otherwise, he
was wont to furtively lift his foot and kick the table. "Hallo,
what's that?" he cried. "Sounds like a gun; that reminds me"&mdash;and
then the story. Thus Mr. <span class="sc">Torrens</span> drags in successive
Parliamentary episodes through twenty years&mdash;the Disestablishment
of the Church, the Charity Commission, State Aid to Emigrants,
School Board for London, Extradition, Artisans' Dwellings; gives a
not very clear summary of events leading up to each, and then treats
the entranced reader to the heads of the speech he delivered. The
book would have been more accurately entitled had it been called
<i>Twenty Years of McCullagh Torrens</i>, and old Members of the House
of Commons will agree that this is a little too much.</p>

<h2>THE FISHERMAN AND THE GENIUS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragmentary and Unfinished Extracts from the Arabian Nights, Up to Date.</i>)</p>

<p>"Sir," said <span class="sc">Sheeverready</span>, "how pleasant soever these stories
may be that I have told your Majesty hitherto, they do not come
near that of the Fisherman and the Genius."</p>

<hr />

<p>There was an ancient, but hale and opulent Fisherman, who had
fished with much success for many a day in troubled waters. This
practice of his involved him, of course, in extremely arduous
labours, but resulted, generally, in securing him a fair share of
hard-earned spoil, to the great envy of other fishermen of less hardihood
and enterprise. He imposed it upon himself, however, as a
law, not to cast his nets save during a certain season&mdash;or session, as
he called it&mdash;which usually arrived but once a year.</p>

<p>His fortune, for some fishing seasons past, had been of a variable,
and not too satisfactory sort. It is <i>not</i> encouraging, after casting
one's nets during a prolonged spell of rough weather, and confidently
anticipating a good draught of fish, to perceive that, instead of fish,
there is nothing in one's net save such unsought spoil as the carcase
of an Egyptian ass, a basket-full of gravel and slime of no substantial
utility, or quantities of stones and mud, fit for nothing but
for use as missiles among quarrelsome boys.</p>

<p>"O Fortune," cried he; "be not so persistently perverse, nor
persecute an ancient fisherman who groweth a-weary of tumultuous
billows, turbid floods, broken and filth-obstructed nets, and unprofitable
hauls!"</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, behold, it was told to this Fisherman by a certain Grand Old
Voice, vague but sonorous, and voluble exceedingly, that if he
would only make a complete change in his nets, and in the fashion
of his fishing, miraculous draughts would become as common as
minnows in a brook. This Voice visited our Fisherman often in his
visions. And, behold, the Fisherman essayed the schemes suggested
by the Voice. Not at first, it must be admitted, with supreme success,
or entire satisfaction to the Fisherman himself. The Voice,
however, attributed this qualified fortune to the Fisherman's lack
of perfect trust, and of entire reform in his fashion of fishing.
"Behold," cried the Voice, vibrating vehemently, "you have allowed
yourself to be diverted by the sinister councils of antiquated obscurantists
from implicit faith in my programmes and prescriptions!"</p>

<p>"And what, in brief and plain language, <i>are</i> these latter?"
inquired the anxious but puzzled Fisherman.</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the Voice, sardonically; "that were to inquire
too nicely. But place your fortunes absolutely in my charge; follow
my lead with unquestioning loyalty, and verily you shall see great
results."</p>

<hr />

<p>The Fisherman, much impressed with these assurances, cast his
nets once more in the new fashion; and when he thought it was
time, he drew them in as formerly, with great difficulty. But,
instead of fish, found nothing in them but a vessel of brass, which,
by the weight, seemed to be full of something; and he observed
that it was shut up with singular tightness, and sealed up with a
thick coating of official-looking wax. And the Seal was Green,
green as the abounding grass, or the scarce four-leaved shamrock of
that amazing Isle of Emeralds, which some deem as much matter of
myth as <span class="sc">Sindbad's</span> Valley of Diamonds.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Fisherman examined the vessel on all sides, and shook it to
see if what was in it made any noise, but heard nothing. This circumstance,
with the impression of the seal upon the cover (which
seemed to represent two Hearts linked in Union by some mystic
abracadabra of unknown words) made him think there was something
precious&mdash;or at least peculiar&mdash;in it. To try this, he opened it.
He presently turned the mouth downward, but nothing came out,
which surprised him extremely. He set it before him, and while he
looked upon it attentively, there arose from it a very thick smoke,
which obliged him to retire two or three paces from it.</p>

<p>The smoke ascended to the clouds, and, extending itself along the
sea and upon the shore, formed a great mist, which we may well
imagine did mightily astonish the Fisherman. When the smoke was
all out of the vessel, it slowly took shape, and became a solid-seeming
body, of which there was formed a Genius twice as high and
broad as any giant with which the Fisherman had been aforetime
familiar. At the sight of a monster of such unsizeable bulk, and
from which issued, in as yet unintelligible accents, a Voice which
seemed strangely familiar to his ears, the Fisherman&mdash;&mdash;Here
<span class="sc">Sheeverready</span> perceiving day, broke off her story&mdash;for the time.</p>

<p>Well done, the A. D. C.! Their performance of <span class="sc">Tom Taylor</span>'s
romantic, pathetic, melodramatic, crib-cracking, head- (though not
always side-) splitting play, was an admirable one, carefully rehearsed,
well stage-managed, and played with a fine feeling for the
capital situations in which the piece abounds.
Especially good was Mr. <span class="sc">Bromley-Davenport</span>'s
<i>Jem Dalton</i>, a finished and truculent
presentment of which any young amateur
and many an old professional might be proud.
<i>Hawkshaw</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Dickinson</span>), too, was excellent,
and the <i>Bob Brierly</i> of Mr. <span class="sc">Thornton</span>,
the <i>Sam Willoughby</i> of Mr. <span class="sc">Theobald</span>, the
<i>Green Jones</i> of Mr. <span class="sc">Norman</span>, and the <i>Maltby</i>
of Mr. <span class="sc">Martineau</span>, were all good in their
several ways. As for the ladies&mdash;but who
does not know the A. D. C. ladies, those
visions of female loveliness, with big hands
bass voices, and projecting knees? Mr.
<span class="sc">Agar</span>, whose waist cannot have really measured more than twenty
inches round, was refined and charming as <i>Emily St. Evremond</i>,
while Mr. <span class="sc">Cornish</span>, though taller than most of his male associates,
played <i>May Edwards</i> quietly, and sympathetically.
<i>Mrs. Willoughby</i>, the stage realisation of <span class="sc">Arthur Sketchley</span>'s
<i>Mrs. Brown</i>, had full justice rendered to her garrulous good-nature
by Mr. <span class="sc">Stone</span>. But enough. It was a good performance.
Memories came floating back of a notable performance of this
same play by the A. D. C. far back in the remote ages between
'70 and '80. The <i>Bob Brierly</i> of those days has been Under-Secretary
of State for India, <i>Hawkshaw</i>, the Detective, occupies
a thorny throne as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, while <i>Jem Dalton</i>
has become the Burglar at the Court Theatre&mdash;a very natural
transition. Very great was Mr. <span class="sc">Brookfield</span> fifteen years ago as
the Cracksman, but great, also, was Mr. <span class="sc">Bromley-Davenport</span> last
week. <i>Dixi!</i></p>

<p>In order to get men, we have been obliged to
invite the gentlemanly crossing-sweeper at the
end of our road, two hawkers who sell blocks of
wood in the street, a respectable coal-heaver,
and our green-grocer's assistant. They have
each had half-a-dozen dancing lessons (at our
expense), and are to be paid a guinea a-piece,
on condition that they dance at least six dances
before going down to supper.</p>

<p>Our boy <span class="sc">Bob</span>, who is always trying to be
funny, says he is afraid engaging these people
will turn put a "valse step."</p>

<p>It certainly is rather slow for the Girls who
have not had a partner all the evening. Still, I did <i>not</i> expect
them to bring pencils and paper with them, and play games of "consequences"
in the billiard-room.</p>

<p>Since Gentlemen have taken to sharing a dance among several
Ladies, they have become very conceited. My <span class="sc">Emily</span> is congratulating
herself that she has secured one undivided sixteenth part of
the next Lancers with that dear Mr. <span class="sc">Wynn Ingways</span>.</p>

<p>A good part of Mr. <span class="sc">Masher</span>'s income is, it is said, derived from
the fact that Mothers, sooner than see their Girls sit idle all the
evening, are willing to allow him a handsome commission on
suitable introductions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bob</span> has asked <span class="sc">Julia</span> a riddle, which is&mdash;"What is the difference
between a game of whist and a ball-room?" The answer seems to
be, that in whist you cut for partners, but, in a ball-room, possible
partners cut you.</p>

<p>It is quite true that we have decided to emigrate to North-West
Colorado, as my Girls say they will have far more chance of partners in
a country where the "surplus population" consists entirely of males.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M. P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, Jan. 31st.</i>&mdash;Back again in old place,
with <span class="sc">Speaker</span> in Chair, Mace on table, and Serjeant-at-Arms on
guard. Nothing changed except the Government. Some old
familiar faces gone; others replace them. Same old bustle, hearty
greeting, and effusive hand-shaking.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing," says <span class="sc">Erskine</span>, of Cardross, "that
equals the hilarity of the opening of a New Session, and that is the
joy with which the boys go off on the day of Prorogation."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Erskine</span> been in the Chair by the cross-benches some years now.
Naturally growing philosophical; insensibly cultivates habit of
sententious speech.</p>

<p>"Wonder you can be so garrulous, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he says, "considering
the number of Speeches you hear in a Session. We take in eloquence
at the pores, and I for one have no tendency toward exudation."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, "perhaps that's the lack of exercise. Dear old
<span class="sc">Gosset</span>! he was better off in that respect. Remember how he used
to waltz up and down between doorway and table with <span class="sc">Bradlaugh</span>?
A heavy partner, too, especially taken after dinner. But, on score of
health, not by any means an undesirable variation on sedentary life."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said <span class="sc">Erskine</span>, whose forbears were out in '45, "we
must hope for the best." And the gallant Scot's hand involuntarily
sought the hilt of his sword as his keen eye roved over the Clan
gathered below the Gangway.</p>

<p>A little odd at first to see Mr. G. on the Bench to the right of
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> facing him on Opposition Bench. They
seem to assume altered position quite naturally. Mr. G. looks pretty
much as he has done any time these two years back. Eager,
straight-backed, bright-eyed, smiling gaily in response to cheer
that greets him from at present undivided majority.</p>

<p>"Pretty well, thank you, <span class="sc">Toby</span>. Only one thing the matter with
me, and that, you know, doesn't mend as the years pass. Looking
over <span class="sc">McCullagh Torrens'</span> book the other day, I noted what <span class="sc">Dizzy</span>
said when that genial statesman, the former Member for Finsbury,
inquired after the health of Lady <span class="sc">Beaconsfield</span>. 'They tell me
she is better, but you know what better is at 83.' I'm as well as
can be expected going o' 84. I must admit it's pretty well. I'll
undertake to walk a mile, run a mile, eat a meal, and make a speech
with any fellow ten years my junior."</p>

<p>Certainly no one on Treasury Bench exceeds Mr. G. in vivacity or
overflowing energy. <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> looks very fit, but there's
a massivity about his mirthful mood that becomes a Chancellor of
the Exchequer with a contingent surplus. Is much comforted by
consciousness that, whilst <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span> views composition
of Ministry with mixed feelings, and will not commit himself
to promise of fealty till he is in possession of full details of their
policy, he unreservedly approves the <span class="sc">Squire</span>.</p>

<p>On other side, Her Majesty's late Ministers in state of almost
boisterous hilarity. Evidently inclined to regard deposition as a
joke. Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> beaming with delight. Something curiously
like a smile wreathes stolid countenance of Sir <span class="sc">James Fergusson</span>.</p>

<p>"It's their turn now," says Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, gleefully rubbing
his hands, "and I wish them joy of it. As for me, I shall live
my Saturday to Monday in peace, and shall go to the Opera every
Wednesday night in the Season."</p>

<p>"You can go oftener if you like," said <span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett</span>
(Knight). "You may depend on my remaining here. I've thought
of a good many things to say during the last six years."</p>

<p>"Ha," said Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, thoughtfully, "then perhaps I may
absent myself through portions of other nights of the week."</p>

<p>Mr. Lestocq's amusing farce, <i>The Sportsman</i>,
now being played at the Comedy Theatre,
must inevitably recall to the experienced play-goer
the plot and situations of <i>The Serious
Family</i> and <i>The Colonel</i>, <i>Truth</i>, <i>The Candidate</i>,
<i>Artful Cards</i>, and it may be some
others of the same extensive dramatic family.
In this piece the husband, under pretence of
joining a shooting-party, is accustomed to
absent himself from home, in order to indulge
his propensity
for gambling,
and he invariably
brings home
to his wife the
hares and rabbits
he has shot. This
is "his little
game." Just so
did the husband
in <i>The Serious
Family</i>, when
<i>Aminadab Sleek</i>
remarks that he
has seen something
very like
them at a neighbouring
poulterer's.
In the
Second Act the
police make a
raid on the gambling
Club, and
the husband escapes
in any coat
he can lay hold
of, following the
example of the
unfortunate hero
of <i>Artful Cards</i>,
only that the
situation at the
end of <i>that</i>
Second Act was
far stronger in
that play than it
is in <i>The Sportsman</i>.
In <i>Artful Cards</i> the unfortunate hero
escaped, carrying a trombone, which turned up
in evidence against him when he was inventing
plausible explanations to his wife. In fact,
<i>The Sportsman</i> is concocted out of excellent
old material cleverly worked up, with
only one new point in it, to which, as it has
escaped the eye of the English adapter, it
would be useless to draw his attention; yet,
had he seen it, he might therefrom have
developed a really original sequence of perplexing
situations. The dialogue is not particularly
brilliant; jerky, not crisp. But such
is the "go" of the principals, and especially
of Mr. <span class="sc">Hawtrey</span>, who is the life and
soul of the farce, that the laughter is hearty
and continuous.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
